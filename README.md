### I am trying to implement the Swipe-Refresh of a recyclerlayout

I uploaded the new branch - mistakeï¼Œfinding that Livedata can't work with adapter. I 've tried some scheme.
First, I place the "adapter.notifyDataSetChanged()" in the Observer of Livedata. After trying for some times, I found that if I just change the value of Livedata other than change the Livedata itself (change the address of Livedata), the Observer will find nothing.
And I found the article which I read serveral days ago. If I want "adapter.notifyDataSetChanged()" work, the list of recyclerlayout'data must keep unchanged, which means I can't change the Livedata itself (I can't change the address of Livedata).
It's easy to find that Observer and Livedata are contradictory. One needs the change of address, the other needs the unchange of address.
So I got the conclusion, I can't implement the function with them.
